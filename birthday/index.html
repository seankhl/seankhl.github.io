      <p>Hello there! I wanted to get you two gifts: one of them is one of those
      books you suggested. I was thinking of getting you a book and do want to
      get you something to help you find your inner calling, and those books
      looked cool, so I picked this one:</p>
      
      <p style="text-align:center;"><embed src="truthfulart.pdf" width="650px" height="750px"></p>

      <p>That's the first 40 pages. If you want it in ebook form, I can have it
      sent to you now, but since it's a visualization book, maybe it would be
      cool to have a hard-copy version of it? I could have it sent to your home
      if you don't have enough space? It's up to you -- I wanted to give you
      some choice.</p>

      <p>The other part of your gift is a new pair of glasses! I wanted for you to
      at least try some of those offered from that online store. We can have
      them shipped here for home try-on to line up with the second part of our
      time in Chicago. I have picked the ones I think you'd like, but we can
      tweak them this afternoon and they will still arrive on time. Maybe one of
      these? With them will come a gift card for the cost of a new pair. When
      you pick the ones you want, I can order them, have them delivered to me,
      and ship them to you.</p>

      <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="glasses.png"></p>

      <p>Anyway, I hope you like the gifts and the mini page. I wish I had
      something larger and more concrete to give you right now, but hopefully
      the extra options it gives will make the gift a little better in the end.
      I admit, I was scared to make a call on the book format or the exact
      frames... but I can still pick for you if you'd like!</p>
